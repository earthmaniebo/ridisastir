# Ridisastir Asset Management System

### Summary of the Problem
Tracking assets—both those available and those already deployed—is a critical part of disaster response. To make the response more effective and efficient, we need a reliable system to manage such assets.

The mismanagement of response assets (such as rubber boats, 4x4 trucks, etc.) contributes greatly in reducing the effectiveness of disaster response teams. With an app to keep track of which resources are still available and which has already been sent where, we can have a better view of the situation and be in a position to respond more effectively.
